# 2022PreSeasonEverybot_Command

After having learned basic FRC robot programming using Timed robot ([2022PreseasonEverybot_Timed](https://github.com/Pearadox/2022PreseasonEverybot_Timed)), our rookie programmers learned Command Based programming using this repo and our 2022 Everybot.

Once the 2023 season started, we enhanced this code to prove we could engage the Charge Station automatically.  We plan to continue this by implementing a complete routine for the autonomous period.

As of this writing, the code is still using a 2022 release of WPILib.
